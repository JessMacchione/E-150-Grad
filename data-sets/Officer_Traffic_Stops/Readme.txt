Officer Traffic Stops
Metadata Updated: February 14, 2018 

CMPD conducts an average of 120,000 traffic stops per year. Under North Carolina state law (G.S. 143B-902-903), the CMPD as well as other law enforcement agencies in the state are required to collect information on all traffic stops, the reason for the stop, and the type of enforcement action taken. Information on the driver’s sex, race, ethnicity, and age is collected, compiled, and reported to the NC Department of Justice. Information on whether the driver or passenger(s) were searched is also collected. For more information, please visit http://charlottenc.gov/CMPD/Pages/Resources/OpenData_Source.aspx

CMPD is committed to deploying traffic officers to areas where we experience high crime and victimization. Our focus is also in the geographical areas where concerns are reported by community members. We as a police department have a responsibility to those communities, to address their concerns and take appropriate enforcement action in an effort to keep their neighborhoods safe. Additionally, we are not only reacting to crime but proactively engaging in strategies that are intended to prevent criminal activity from occurring by placing officers in areas with a greater statistical history of crime.
